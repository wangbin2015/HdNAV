Hdmap is an open source JavaScript library for **mobile-friendly interactive maps**.
It is developed by [Vladimir Agafonkin][] of [MapBox][] with a team of dedicated [contributors][].
Weighing just about 30 KB of gzipped JS code, it has all the [features][] most developers ever need for online maps.

Hdmap is designed with *simplicity*, *performance* and *usability* in mind.
It works efficiently across all major desktop and mobile platforms out of the box,
taking advantage of HTML5 and CSS3 on modern browsers while being accessible on older ones too.
It can be extended with a huge amount of [plugins][],
has a beautiful, easy to use and [well-documented][] API
and a simple, readable [source code][] that is a joy to [contribute][] to.

We're happy to meet new contributors.
If you want to **get involved** with Hdmap development, check out the [contribution guide][contribute].
Let's make the best mapping library that will ever exist,
and push the limits of what's possible with online maps!
